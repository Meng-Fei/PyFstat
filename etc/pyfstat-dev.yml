# 1. to ensure correct relative path for the editable mode installation,
# always create your environment while at the root directory of your pyfstat git clone.
#
# 2. to avoid having duplicate lalsuite packages from both conda and pip,
# please always run as
# NO_LALSUITE_FROM_PYPI=1 mamba env create -f etc/pyfstat-dev.yml
