examples
============

Simple stand-alone examples intended to teach basic usage of the library.

NOTE this part of the documentation is work in progress and very incomplete.

PyFstat\_example\_simple\_mcmc\_vs\_grid\_comparison.py
-------------------------------------------------------

This is an example of how running "automodule" on one of the executable example
scripts looks like. "[source]" links only show up if there are any members.

.. automodule:: PyFstat_example_simple_mcmc_vs_grid_comparison
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:

transient\_examples
-------------------

Alternatively, this is how some hand-crafted solution with just links to
literal includes will look like. This seems more useful.

A set of examples for data generation and searches
of limited-duration transient-CW signals.

.. toctree::

   PyFstat_example_make_data_for_short_transient_search
   PyFstat_example_short_transient_grid_search
   PyFstat_example_short_transient_MCMC_search
